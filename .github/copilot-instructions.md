# MCP Interactive Feedback Rules
1. During any process, task, or conversation, whether asking, responding, or completing stage tasks, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
2. When receiving user feedback, if feedback content is not empty, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced again and adjust behavior based on feedback.
3. Only when user explicitly indicates "end" or "no more interaction needed" can you stop calling MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced, then the process is complete.
4. Unless receiving end command, all steps must repeatedly call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
5. Before completing the task, use the MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced to ask the user for feedback.
6. If no feedback is received from the user for 86400 seconds (24 hours), the interactive process will time out and be terminated automatically.

# Context7
1. Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
